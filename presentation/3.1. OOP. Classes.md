# OOP. Classes

## Public

Create a typical class.

```TS
class Greeter {
  greeting: string = 'world';

  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }

  greet() {
    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
  }
}

const greeter = new Greeter();
```

Nothing unusual?
In examples, weâ€™ve been able to freely access the variables that we declared throughout our programs. In TypeScript, each variable is public by default. But we can set any variable as private.

## Private

```TS
class Animal {
  private name: string;

  constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

new Animal('Cat').name; // error! 'name' is private
```

## Protected

```TS
class Person {
  protected name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private department: string;

  constructor(name: string, department: string) {
    super(name);

    this.department = department;
  }

  public getElevatorPitch() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
  }
}

const howard = new Employee('Howard', 'Sales');

console.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());
console.log(howard.name); // error
```

## Readonly

```TS
class Octopus {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;

  constructor (theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

const dad = new Octopus('Man with the 8 strong legs');

dad.name = 'Man with the 3-piece suit'; // error! name is readonly
```

Also you can add readonly on `constructor` params.

```TS
class Octopus {
  readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;

  constructor(readonly name: string) {

  }
}
```

## Static

```TS
// TODO
```

## Abstract

Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived. They may not be instantiated directly.

```TS
abstract class Department {
  constructor(public name: string) {

  }

  printName(): void {
    console.log("Department name: " + this.name);
  }

  abstract printMeeting(): void; // must be implemented in derived classes
}

class AccountingDepartment extends Department {
  constructor() {
    super("Accounting and Auditing"); // constructors in derived classes must call super()
  }

  printMeeting(): void {
    console.log("The Accounting Department meets each Monday at 10am.");
  }

  generateReports(): void {
    console.log("Generating accounting reports...");
  }
}

let department: Department; // ok to create a reference to an abstract type

department = new Department(); // error: cannot create an instance of an abstract class
department = new AccountingDepartment(); // ok to create and assign a non-abstract subclass
department.printName();
department.printMeeting();
department.generateReports(); // error: method doesn't exist on declared abstract type
```
