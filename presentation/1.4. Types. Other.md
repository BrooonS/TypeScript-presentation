# Types. Other

## Void

`void` is a little like the opposite of `any`: the absence of having any type at all. You may commonly see this as the return type of functions that do not return a value:

```TS
function warnUser(): void {
  alert('This is my warning message');
}
```

Declaring variables of type void is not useful because you can only assign `undefined` or `null` to them:

```TS
let unusable: void = undefined;
```

## Null and Undefined

In TypeScript, both `undefined` and `null` actually have their own types named undefined and null respectively. Much like void, they're not extremely useful on their own:

```TS
let u: undefined = undefined;
let n: null = null;
```

## Never

The `never` type represents the type of values that never occur. For instance, `never` is the return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression that always throws an exception or one that never returns; Variables also acquire the type `never` when narrowed by any type guards that can never be true.

```TS
// Function returning never must have unreachable end point
function error(message): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

// Inferred return type is never
function fail() {
  return error("Something failed");
}

// Function returning never must have unreachable end point
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {

  }
}
```

## Type assertions

Sometimes you'll end up in a situation where you'll know more about a value than TypeScript does. Usually this will happen when you know the type of some entity could be more specific than its current type.

```TS
let someValue: any = 'this is a string';

const strLength1: number = (<string>someValue).length; // 1st way
const strLength2: number = (someValue as string).length; // 2nd way
```
